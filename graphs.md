### Graphs
<br>

#### Graphs, in the context of computer science and mathematics, are data structures used to represent relationships between objects. They consist of a set of vertices (also called nodes) and a set of edges (also called arcs) that connect pairs of vertices.

#### Graphs are widely used in various fields, including computer science, data analysis, network analysis, and optimization. They provide a flexible way to model and analyze complex systems and relationships.


#### Here are some key terms and concepts related to graphs:

<br>

- Vertices (Nodes): 
    ##### Vertices are the fundamental units of a graph. They represent objects or entities and are usually depicted as points or circles. Each vertex can have a label or additional attributes associated with it.

<br>

- Edges (Arcs): 
    ##### Edges are the connections between vertices in a graph. They represent the relationships or interactions between the corresponding objects. Edges can be directed (arrows indicating a one-way connection) or undirected (lines indicating a two-way connection).

<br>

- Adjacency: 
    ##### Two vertices in a graph are adjacent if there is an edge connecting them. The adjacency matrix or adjacency list is used to represent the connectivity between vertices.

<br>

- Degree: 
    ##### The degree of a vertex is the number of edges connected to it. In a directed graph, the degree can be divided into in-degree (number of incoming edges) and out-degree (number of outgoing edges).

<br>

- Path: 
    ##### A path is a sequence of vertices connected by edges. It can be used to represent a sequence of steps or transitions between objects in the graph.

<br>

- Cycle: 
    ##### A cycle is a path that starts and ends at the same vertex, traversing a sequence of edges and vertices without repeating any.

<br>

- Connected Graph: 
    ##### A connected graph is one in which there is a path between every pair of vertices. It means that all vertices are reachable from any other vertex in the graph.

<br>

- Weighted Graph: 
    ##### In some graphs, edges may have weights or costs associated with them. These weights can represent distances, capacities, or any other relevant attributes.

<br>

- Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG): 
    ##### A directed acyclic graph is a graph that has a directed edge between vertices but does not contain any cycles. DAGs are often used in modeling dependencies, scheduling, and flow networks.

<br>

- Graph Algorithms: 
    ##### There are several algorithms designed to solve problems on graphs. Some commonly used algorithms include breadth-first search (BFS), depth-first search (DFS), Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest path, and Kruskal's algorithm for finding the minimum spanning tree.

<br>

#### Graph theory is a rich field of study with many applications and advanced concepts. It provides a powerful framework for solving problems related to connectivity, optimization, network analysis, and more.
