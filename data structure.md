## Data 
A data structure is a storage that is used to store and organize data.
It is a way of arranging data on a computer so that it can be accessed and updated efficiently.

#types of data:
array 
list 
stack
queue 
Graph
Hash Table

##RECURSION:
 A function calls itself directly or indirectly is called recursion
  Used in Many Algorithms is building blocks
  
  #Things I want to know more about
    - Algorithms
    - Big O
    -Trees
    -Queues
Why its important? Data Structures are a specialized means of organizing and storing data in computers in such a way that we can perform operations on the stored data more efficiently. Data structures have a wide and diverse scope of usage across the fields of Computer Science and Software Engineering.

## What is 1 of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem?
Time and Space complexity.

## How can we ensure that weâ€™ll avoid an infinite recursive call stack? 
Assigning Base Case.
