## Pain vs. Suffering
During such an intense class for sure most time you will pass through stress at many aspects such like:
 - Mental push: when you have hard problems to solve in a short time.
 - Emotional push: when realize you lack of understanding of a topic.
 - Psychological & physical push: be thrust far outside of your comfort zone and you’ll lose sleep, you’ll forget to work out, and you’ll feel exhausted all while being filled with information day after day.  


## Big O Notation
Big O notation  describes the performance or complexity of an algorithm. Big O specifically describes the worst-case scenario, and can be used to describe the execution time required or the space used .
O(1) describes an algorithm that will always execute in the same time (or space) regardless of the size of the input data set.
O(N) describes an algorithm whose performance will grow linearly and in direct proportion to the size of the input data set. 
O(N²) represents an algorithm whose performance is directly proportional to the square of the size of the input data set



##  Python names and values
Many names can refer to one value.
Names are reassigned independently of other names.
 Changes in a value are visible through all of its names. (Mutable Presto-Chango)
 Python assigns mutable and immutable values differently.
