# Class 36 - DSA Review

## What are the key pieces of advice mentioned in the “Whiteboard Advice” reading assignment for successfully tackling whiteboard interviews?

The advice is to **communicate**, what do we mean by that? we mean that you should:

- **Listen** to the interviewer.
- **Restate** the question.
- **Ask questions** ask about the input, the output, the edge cases, the constraints, and the assumptions.

## From the “6 tips to ace a whiteboard programming interview” article, can you identify and explain at least two strategies that can help improve your performance during a whiteboard programming interview?

### 1- Take a few minutes

take a few minutes to understand the problem, ask questions, and think about the solution

During mock interviews, candidates often make the mistake of talking without thinking. take a moment to think before speaking and I suggest techniques like closing your eyes or scribbling on a whiteboard to gather thoughts.

### 2- Come prepared

If you want to be ready, you have to put in the time. In the interview, knowing that you’ve done all you can to prepare helps you stay calm and cool, and increases your chances of success.

## What does Gayle McDowell say about interview preparation in the Engineering Interview Process Deconstructed video?

She talks about problems with the interview process and how it can be biased. she suggest not asking certain types of questions and focusing on a candidate's ability to solve problems instead. she recommend candidates to have a good understanding of basic concepts in programming and to challenge themselves with harder problems. she also highlights the importance of how candidates communicate their experiences and skills. she acknowledge that there is no perfect interview process and that different companies have different approaches. They mention that problem-solving questions can give some idea of a candidate's future performance, but they are not the only factor to consider.
