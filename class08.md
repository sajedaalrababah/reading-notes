Class 08 - Stacks and Queues
Stacks
A stack is a data structure that consists of Nodes. Each Node references the next Node in the stack, but does not reference its previous, it follows the LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) principle.

you can think of it as a stack of books, you can only add a book to the top of the stack, and you can only remove the top book.

queue
A queue is a linear data structure in computer science that follows the FIFO (First-In-First-Out) principle.

you can think of it as a queue of people waiting for a atm, the first person to arrive is the first person to get served.

What they are used for
Stacks and queues are used when you need to store and retrieve data in a particular order.

Stacks are used for undo and redo operations in text editors, compiler syntax checking, carrying out recursive function calls, depth-first search, and other cases where we care about the last action performed.

Queues, meanwhile, are used for asynchronous web service communication, scheduling CPU processes, tracking the N most recently added elements, breadth-first search, and any time we care about servicing requests in the order theyâ€™re received.

Terminology
stack terminology
Push - Nodes or items that are put into the stack are pushed

Pop - Nodes or items that are removed from the stack are popped. When you attempt to pop an empty stack an exception will be raised.

Top - This is the top of the stack.

Peek - When you peek you will view the value of the top Node in the stack. When you attempt to peek an empty stack an exception will be raised.

IsEmpty - returns true when stack is empty otherwise returns false.

queue terminology
Enqueue - Nodes or items that are added to the queue.

Dequeue - Nodes or items that are removed from the queue. If called when the queue is empty an exception will be raised.

Front - This is the front/first Node of the queue.

Rear - This is the rear/last Node of the queue.

Peek - When you peek you will view the value of the front Node in the queue. If called when the queue is empty an exception will be raised.

IsEmpty - returns true when queue is empty otherwise returns false.
