# Class 29: Django Custom User

## What are the key benefits of using a Django Custom User Model, and how does it differ from the default Django User Model?

The default Django User Model is not suitable for all projects. It is a good idea to create a custom user model for all new Django projects. Using a custom user model allows you to store additional information about users. It also makes it easier to change the user model in the future if the needs of your project change.

Using a Django Custom User Model provides key benefits such as flexibility, scalability, improved security, easier integration with existing user systems, and avoiding upgrading issues. It differs from the default Django User Model by allowing field customization, requiring manual compatibility handling, and needing customizations for the administration interface.

## Explain the process of creating and implementing a Custom User Model in Django, including the necessary changes to settings.py and the required model fields

1. Create a new Django project
2. Create a new app within the project
3. Add the new app to the project's settings.py file
4. Create a new CustomUser model in the new app's models.py file
5. Create a new UserCreationForm and UserChangeForm in the new app's forms.py file
6. Update the new app's admin.py file to register the new CustomUser model

## What is DjangoX and how does it complement or extend the functionality of Django? Provide an example use case for incorporating DjangoX in a project

DjangoX is a Django starter framework that includes a custom user model, email/password authentication, social authentication via django-allauth, and more. It is a good starting point for new Django projects.

example use case: You are starting a new Django project and want to use a custom user model. You also want to use social authentication via django-allauth. You could create a new Django project and add a custom user model and django-allauth, or you could use DjangoX, which already includes these features.
