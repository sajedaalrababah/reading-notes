## Reading Questions
### What are the key principles of Test-Driven Development (TDD) in Python, and how do they contribute to the overall quality of code?
The key principles (TDD) are to write a failing test, write the minimum amount of code to pass the test, and then refactor the code. by doing this you can ensure that your code is working as intended and that it is of high quality, and you can refactor your code without fear of breaking it, because you have tests to ensure that it is working as intended.

### Explain the purpose of the if __name__ == '__main__': statement in Python scripts. What are some use cases for including this conditional in your code?
By using the if name == 'main': statement, you can ensure that the module behaves correctly whether it is run as a standalone program or imported into another program. Running the module as a standalone program for testing or demonstration purposes.

some use cases:

Running the module as a standalone program for testing or demonstration purposes.
Including test code or debugging statements that should only be executed when the module is run as the main program.
Including setup or initialization code that should only be executed when the module is run as the main program.
### Describe the concept of recursion in Python.
Recursion is a technique where a function calls itself repeatedly until it reaches a base case. It's used to solve problems that can be broken down into smaller problem of the same type.

### What is the difference between Python modules and packages?
The main difference between Python modules and packages is that a module is a single file, while a package is a directory that contains one or more modules. A package provides a way to organize related modules into a hierarchy, while a module is simply a way to reuse code across multiple scripts or modules.
